# DarkNet-Obj-Training

Colab file copied from Roboflow and modified to suit.

Vision.py is the ython file that uses teh tflite file downloaded in the Colab outputs. This then performs vision checking on a image (can be got from camera or dropped into a directory. The file resizes andpads the input file to the required size that the tflite model was trained at. Default is 512x512

Need to use the github repo from https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite.git
